             Singing has always been one of my favorite pastimes. I have worked and practiced countless hours to develop my skills and improve my vocal performance. My senior year of high school, I was part of a vocal jazz group called Westwinds, and we had been practicing this piece to perform at our graduation. When COVID ended our senior year early, we were devastated to not be able to perform this piece, for which we had worked very hard. We were able to each individually record our part and mix the audios, and create this video as our gift to the class of 2020!
